Hello Please help Gunther understand how code is working and why the answer will be this . Explain the working of code in detail. Doubt image is attatched which you have to explain.

In line c=a,b;
c will be assigned value of a and b will remain as such. Here, comma is being used as a separator.
In line d=(a,b), comma is being used as an operator in which the first operand (a) is considered/executed and its value is discarded. Then the second operand (b) is executed and its value is returned, i.e., assigned to d.
Therefore  output:
5 6
